I am currently endeavoring to rewrite an application that I created during my first year of college, for a lesson utilizing the Rust programming language.

The application in question serves as a straightforward directory for organizing and tracking the birthdays of my friends, via a command line interface.

Upon rediscovering the original code, which spanned three to four pages in **C**, I felt motivated to undertake the project in Rust, both for the sake of enjoyment and as a means of acquainting myself with the language.
